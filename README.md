# boxstarter-dev-machine
Boxstarter script for a development machine

To kick it off, run the following line from a Powershell prompt:

```
START http://boxstarter.org/package/nr/url?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groovyghoul/boxstarter-dev-machine/master/bytemares.BoxstarterDev/tools/ChocolateyInstall.ps1
```

#### Troubleshooting:

##### Problem:
Stuck on Windows "Restarting..." screen
##### Solution:
Either be patient, it may just be taking a long time to do an update...just leave it be, or power down the machine and power back on again. It seems to be stuck in the middle of a Windows update. I did this and after logging back in, everything kicked back in at the next installation step.
